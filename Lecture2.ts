// In typescript, type annotaion is a way of explicitily specifying the type of a variable, function parameter or a function return value .
// Type annotaions are expressed by using a colon(:) followed by the desired type after the variable or function parameter declaration. There can be a space after the colon.

// Advantages of type annotation

// It helps the typescript compiler to enforce type checking and provide type safety during development.
// It also tell what operations could we performed on that variable or Vavalue .
// Type safety in typescript refers to the guarantee that operation performed on a value will respect its declared type.

// Number Type:

// Number type represent numeric values , including integers anf floating-point numbers .
// Number type in typescript supports arithmetic operations such as AddEventListenerOptions, subtraction, multiplication and division. The result of these operations on number type is also a number.

// Boolean type:
// In typescript, boolean type represent a value that can be either true or false. It is one of the basic primitive types in language.

// BigInt type:
// It is a built-in type that allows you to work with numbers that are larger than the range supported by the number type.
// BigInt literals are written by appending the n suffix to integer literal.
// In JS, we can not read the whole number beyoun 2 raise to power 53.
// const max=Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
// You can intialize bigint by BigInt constructor also.
