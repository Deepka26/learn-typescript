// Typescript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and advanced features to the language. It helps developers to catch potential errors during compilation. With Typescript, you can enjoy the benefits of object-oriented programming and compile-time error checking, making your code more maintainable and reliable.

// It is javascript superset which means any valid javascript code is also a typescript code.

// Declaring variables:
let fName2:string="Deepka";
console.log(fName2)
// This colon is called static typing.
// Typescript catches error at compile time insted of run time which makes debugging easier, and reduces the likelihood of bugs in production.

// Advantages:
// Easier to read.
// Easier to Write   
// easier to maintain  

// Disadvantage
// The main disadavantage is that browser does not understand typescript so the end it is transpiled in to javascript.
